# Electronics Store Purchases

## üìù Introduction
In this, we use Pandas & Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months' worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.
